"Title: Weighted back extension. Desc: The weighted back extension is an exercise targeting the spinal erectors, as well as the glutes and hamstrings. Back extensions are often done for high reps without weight, but when done with weight, they can be an excellent accessory movement for deadlift strength as well as an overall posterior-chain strength builder. Because your back is the limiting factor, it's still an exercise that is usually done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher. You can weight it with a plate or by holding a dumbbell or other weight in your hands.. Equipment: Body Only. BodyPart: Lower Back.

"Title: Single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift. Desc: The single-leg dumbbell Romanian deadlift is a movement targeting the muscles of the hamstrings, glutes, and back. The difference between a Romanian deadlift and a stiff-legged deadlift is the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. If balance is a challenge, this movement is still very effective if performed while holding on to a stable object for support.. Equipment: Dumbbell. BodyPart: Quadriceps.
